Contributing to Filecoin consensus Research
=====

**Disclaimer:** While we work hard to document our work as it progresses, research progress may not be fully reflected here for some time, or may be worked out out-of-band.

In general, we try to focus on a single set of problems at a time, but we welcome any contributions across the [open problems]() we have!

## Consensus Questions?

You may want to check out the [usual sources]() for an answer.

Still haven't found an answer to your question? Open an issue, and tag it with `question`.

## Problems with consensus?

Have you found a problem with the Protocol?

Open an issue and tag it with `bug`. We would love to engage with you on it, and potentially start working together to solve it.

## Ideas for our `unsolved-problems`?

How exciting! Engage on the relevant issue and let's take our collaboration forward from there!

## New Ideas?

Share them with the community by opening up a new issue and tagging it with `idea/brainstorm`.
