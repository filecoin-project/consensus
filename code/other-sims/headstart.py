# This scripts computes the maximum probability that an attacker can pull off a
# successfull headstart attacks.
# Intuition: For the attack to work, the sum of (1) its blocks Bj at round J and
# (2) its block B_j+1 at round j+1  needs to be greater than the honest number
# of blocks at round J+1. Since both honests and attacker are the same honest
# blocks at round J, they donâ€™t make a difference in the chain weight.
# **Analysis**: 
# Describes number of blocks found in a block by using Poisson dist.
# Hj = #  of honest blocks at round j
# Xj = # of malicious blocks at round j
# We want to find the maximum probability as follow:
# SUM: For all k1, k2: Pr[ Hj+1 < k1 + k2 | Xj = k1, Xj+1 = k2 ] * Pr[ Xj = k1 ] * Pr[ Xj+1 = k2]
# Inner loop: Pr[ Hj+1 < k1 + k2] = CDF_Poisson(k1+k2-1)
