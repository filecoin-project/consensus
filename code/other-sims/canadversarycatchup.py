## Here we consider the epoch boundary attack with a Byzantine (i.e. not rational
## fully malicious adversary).
##Â The idea is that whenever the adversary is elected leader it could potentially
## maintain two chains of same weight growing, but as soon as it is not
## elected leader anymore, then the honest players will have to converge to the same
## chain, assuming perfect synchronicity.
## however when the adversary is not elected leader (and stops the epoch boundary attack)
## it could still try and maintain the chain that has been abandoned by the honest players
## if the adversary gets luck then the abandoned chain can catch up with the other chain
## and thus the adversary can continue the epoch boundary attack.
