# Consensus WG

**Description**: Focus on formalizing design aspects of and proving the security of Filecoin Expected Consensus

**Members**: Wyatt, Henri with support from Juan, Nicola, Why, Brian

##  Mission

- Finalize design aspects of Consensus starting with EC to make it secure and workable for wanted Filecoin design
- Formalize parameters and other implementation requirements to produce a clear Filecoin Consensus spec implementable by dev team
- Define and prove Filecoin Consensus security properties

## Strategy of work

- **Internal research**
  - We try and work in weekly sprints with clear individual deliverables mapped out in each of our weekly meetings
  - Ongoing issue discussions are typically tracked in GH issues or other notes
  - More formal work is moved to LaTex
- **External research**
  - We are working to involve outside researchers to our endeavors, TBD.


## Current Problems

- Randomness sampling strategy
- Weighting Function impact on Consensus
- Attack resistance and parameter choices
- EC/SPC interface (for both SLE and SSLE)
- Block Delay
- Finality
