## Attacks

author: @sternhenri

-----------

We must keep in mind these attacks (effect):

- Block Grinding (soundness)
- Power table Grinding (soundness)
- Challenge grinding (soundness)
- Attack affecting multi-parent consensus (where chain weighting is involved): grind for a while to gain advantage for chain weight in time
- Double Spending (soundness)
- Nothing at stake (consistency/convergence)
- Selfish Mining/Withheld blocks (convergence)
- Exponential Forking - Mining atop all subtrees in a “Heaviest chain” protocol (a la GHOST)
- Costless simulation attack, or posterior corruption or long term attack -- Coercing past stakeholders far after they have sold out of currency, and rewriting history from farback
